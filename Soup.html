        History Of Soup
    </h1>
        <p> The word soup derives from the Latin word ‘suppa‘, which refers to bread soaked in broth. It was popularised in the 1600s by the French ‘soupe‘. The word is also found in Proto-Germanic language as ‘sup‘, which means ‘to make liquid’ <br>
        In Xianrendong Cave, Jiangxi Province, China, the first example of a soup bowl was discovered and thought to date back to 20,000 BC. The ancient pottery showed scorch marks, which would suggest the user was making a hot soup of some kind. While this is the earliest example of a soup bowl, ancient soup makers may have simply dug a pit, lined it with animal skin or gut, filled this “pot” with water and dropped in some hot rocks.
    </p> <br>
        <p> The use of hot rocks to boil water was a known practice amongst Neanderthals around this time. Indeed, boiling water is thought to follow roasting, and precede baking. Neanderthals were thought to have boiled bones to render fats that prevent protein poisoning. The result was a drinkable broth created in the water. <br>
        Conquering the ancient world for over 500 years, the Roman Empire had a big impact on the history of ancient soup. They brought the recipe of Gazpacho to Southern Spain, where it became a region famous for the dish. They also created Minutal Apicianum, a traditional wedding soup.
        Meanwhile, in the 7th century, in the city of Turpan, the Chinese were developing one of their mainstay soup ingredients – the humble wantan, or “shallow cloud”. It was so called because of the way the little pork dumplings floated in broths. We know them today as wontons.
        In 476 AD, with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, soup survived in the Byzantine Empire centred on Constantinople. With its fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1454, soups of Central Asian began to influence European soup culture. Unlike Western Europeans, the Turkish used lots of vegetables in their soups and did not limit soup consumption to a particular time of day or a specific course during a meal.</p></div>
