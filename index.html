            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="list1">Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, leek, yellow squash and asparagus. Sauté until tender, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add 2 cups chicken stock and coconut milk, and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
                <li class="list2">In a small bowl, add arrowroot powder and a tablespoon of cold water. Whisk to combine. Add gradually to vegetable mixture, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens. If your mixture becomes too thick, add a bit more stock, stirring constantly until you reach a desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in cooked chicken and herbs. Pour pot pie filling into a 13 x 9 inch baking dish, set aside.</li>
                <li class="list3">Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
                <li class="list4">In a large bowl, add coconut flour, baking soda, salt and pepper. Whisk to combine. In a medium bowl, add eggs, coconut oil, coconut milk, apple cider vinegar and 2 teaspoons of water, then whisk until frothy. Pour liquid ingredients into bowl with dry ingredients, and stir to combine.</li>
                <li class="list5">Spoon topping batter over pot pie filling in eight equal portions. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until filling is bubbling and topping is deeply golden and a little crusty. Serve with a garnish of minced parsley.</li>
