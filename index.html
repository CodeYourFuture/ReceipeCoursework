            <p>Today I would love to share with you my favorite Ukrainian mushroom soup recipe. </p>
            <p>This Ukrainian mushroom soup recipe has surprisingly simple ingredients and
            is easy to make. Despite the fact that it is considered a gourmet dish, even an inexperienced cook can make it without any special knowledge and effort.</p>
            <p>In Ukraine, due to the diversity of Carpathian cuisine, people prepare this mushroom soup differently. Even in the same village, the taste of the soup can differ from house to house.</p>
            <p>In Ukraine, due to the diversity of Carpathian cuisine, people prepare this mushroom soup differently. Even in the same village, the taste of the soup can differ from house to house.</p>
            <p>In fact, in Ukraine , we say that the most delicious mushroom soup is always prepared with porcini mushrooms. They can be fresh or dried, however, dried mushrooms enhance the flavor and bring a more unique aroma.</p>
            <p>If you don’t have porcini, use oyster mushrooms, chanterelle, or king trumpet mushrooms. But do not use buttons, portabello, or cremini ones. At least not for this soup.</p>

            <h2>How to Make Ukrainian Porcini Mushroom Soup</h2>
            <h2>Ingridients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>150 grams (5.5 oz) of dried porcini mushrooms </li>
                <li>1 Medium Carrot</li>
                <li>2-3 medium bay leaves </li>
                <li>1 big (or 2 smaller) onions</li>
                <li>1 small potato </li>
                <li>4 Tbsp of olive oil</li>
                <li>3 liters (12.5 cups) of water</li>
                <li>salt & ground black pepper to taste </li>
                <li>1/4 tsp of dill (fresh or frozen)</li>
                <li>sour cream (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse dried mushrooms under running water and then put them to soak in a pot with 1-2 liters of water for 5-6 hours. If you leave them for longer, that’s ok too. But don’t soak them for more than 10 hours because they’ll be too soggy.</li>
                <li>Remove mushrooms from the pot, squeeze them, and cut into smaller pieces (if they were big).</li>
                <li>Filter the water (where you soaked mushrooms) through several layers of <span><a htef="">cooking gauze</a></span>  to get rid of debris and sand. Make sure not to pour it away (!!!) since this is the most flavorful soup base! Into the same pot with filtered mushroom infusion put mushrooms, add more water (to have around 3 liters of liquid in total), salt, and black peppercorns. Place on the stove and bring it to a boil.</li>
                <li>As soon as it boils, there may be a foam. Remove it carefully with a skimmer, reduce heat and simmer for about 30-35 minutes. The readiness of mushrooms is determined when during cooking they begin to sink to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, peel and chop a potato, dice an onion, and shred a carrot.</li>
                <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add 4 Tbsp of olive oil. Add diced onion and saute for 2-3 minutes stirring often and not letting it burn. Then add carrots and saute all together for about 5 more minutes. If you see that carrots are too dry, add a bit more oil.</li>
                <li>When mushrooms cook for 30-35 minutes, add chopped potatoes and simmer for additional 15-20 minutes. Once potatoes reach desired softness, add sauteed carrots with onions and continue to simmer the soup under a closed lid for another 10 minutes.
                    <p>At the same time when you add carrots, add the bay leaf but remove it from the soup in 15 minutes. If necessary, add more salt.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Once your porcini mushroom soup is ready, turn the heat off but leave it under a lid to infuse for at least 2 minutes. But the longer it infuses, the more flavorful it will become. You’ll see that on the following day the mushroom taste will be much stronger.</li>
                <li>When serving, sprinkle with finely cut dill and add a bit of sour cream (if you wish).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>What to Serve With Mushroom Soup?</h3>
            <p>In Ukraine, depending on the region, porcini mushroom soup can be served as it is or with boiled homemade pasta or buckwheat. My family likes to eat it with traditional egg noodles or with regular pasta and it was as tasty. </p>
