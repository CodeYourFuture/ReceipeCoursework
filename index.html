            In Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century Baghdadi cookbook Kitab
            al-Tabikh (Arabic: كتاب الطبيخ), a compendium of much of the legacy
            of Mesopotamian, Persian, and Arab cuisine, there are descriptions
            of kabāb as cut-up meat, either fried in a pan or grilled over a
            fire.[3] However, while the word kebab or shish kebab may sometimes
            be used in English as a culinary term that refers to any type of
            small chunks of meat cooked on a skewer,[1] kebab is mainly
            associated with a diversity of meat dishes that originated in the
            medieval kitchens of Persia and Anatolia.[4] Though the word has
            ancient origins, it was popularized in the West by Turks to refer to
            this range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be cooked on
            skewers, but also as stews, meatballs, and other forms.[1][4] This
            cuisine has spread around the world, in parallel with Muslim
            influence.[1] According to Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveller, kebab
            was served in the royal houses during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526
            CE), and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast with naan.[5]

            Although the history of baklava is not well documented, its current
            form was probably developed in the imperial kitchens of the Topkapı
            Palace in Constantinople (now known in English as Istanbul).[16][17]
            The Sultan presented trays of baklava to the Janissaries every 15th
            of the month of Ramadan in a ceremonial procession called the
            Baklava Alayı.[18][19] The three main proposals for the pre-Ottoman
            roots of baklava are the Ancient Roman placenta cake,[20] the
            Central Asian Turkic tradition of layered desserts,[21] and the
            lauzinaj.[18] There are also claims attributing baklava to the
            Assyrians, according to which baklava was already prepared by them
            in the 8th century BC.[22][23] There are also some similarities
            between baklava and the Ancient Greek desserts gastris
            (γάστρις),[24] kopte sesamis (κοπτὴ σησαμίς), and kopton (κοπτόν)
            found in book XIV of the Deipnosophistae.[25][26] However, the
            recipe there is for a filling of nuts and honey, with a top and
            bottom layer of honey and ground sesame similar to modern pasteli or
            halva, and no dough, certainly not a flaky dough.[27]

            Turkish coffee probably was brought in the Ottoman Empire by
            traveling merchants by the 15th century. The governor in charge of
            Yemen, Özdemir Pasha, may have officially introduced it to Sultan
            Suleiman the Magnificent, who popularized it. Under the strictest
            interpretations of the Quran, the strong coffee was considered a
            drug and its consumption was forbidden. Sultan Murad IV outlawed
            coffee, but due to the immense popularity of the beverage, the
            prohibition was eventually lifted.[11][12] Turkish coffee culture
            had reached Britain and France by the mid to late 17th century. The
            first coffee house in Britain was opened by an Ottoman Jew in the
            mid 17th century. In the 1680s, the Turkish ambassador to France
            reportedly threw lavish parties for the city's elite where African
            slaves served coffee to guests in porcelain finjans on gold or
            silver saucers.[5]
